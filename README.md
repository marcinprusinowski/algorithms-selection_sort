# Selection Sort!

Selection sort mechanism is based on finding the smallest possible element in unsorted array and replace it with element on the current pointer position. Which in my case is an "I" iterator in loop. The "I" point the first element of unsorted array. I like learning by visualisation, so there is quick video showing Selection Sort in action.

# Conclusion
Selection sort is in place sorting algorithm.
It's time complexity in every case is O(n*n).
It allways has to go via nested loop and select the smallest one from unsorted array even if pointer is the smallest one.
Feel free to download the code and try, but I suggest you to implement it by yourself first.
